# Intersection app
A simple app that calculates intersection point of two lines written in Swift.  
It was a project that we had to make during studies, originally written in Python. Later I decided to remake it in Swift.

# UI
<p float = "left">
  <img src = "https://github.com/jacksonafide/intersection-app/blob/master/Images/mainUI.png" width = "25%" height = "25%"/>
  <img src = "https://github.com/jacksonafide/intersection-app/blob/master/Images/testValues.png" width = "25%" height = "25%"/>
</p>

# Functionality
* Insert coordinates of 4 points
* Press calculate intersection point
* Results should appear below as coordinates and an image showing points in the coordinate system
* Then you can change color or width of the two lines using options buttons
